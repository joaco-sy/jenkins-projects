# Implementing Secure CI/CD Pipelines

This code snippet is a declarative Jenkins Pipeline script that defines the build and deployment process for a Java web application. It automates various stages of the software development lifecycle, including:
- source code scanning for secrets and vulnerabilities
- performing Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- and deploying the application to a Tomcat server. 



## Agent Configuration:

agent any

This indicates that the pipeline can be executed on any available Jenkins agent.


## Tool Configuration:

   > tools { \
   > maven 'Maven' \
   > } 

This specifies that the pipeline will use the Maven tool installed in the Jenkins environment.



## Stages:

The pipeline consists of several stages, each representing a phase in the build and deployment process.

### Start Stage:
This stage is just for informational purposes and prints the environment variables PATH and M2_HOME.

### Check-Git-Secrets Stage:
This stage checks the code repository for secrets using the TruffleHog tool, a password scanning tool to prevent sensitive data from being committed ccidentally.

### OWASP Dependency-Check Vulnerabilities Stage:
This stage runs the OWASP Dependency-Check tool to scan for known vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies. The results are saved in various ormats for further analysis.

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing) Stage:
In this stage, SonarQube is used for SAST. The SonarQube scanner for Maven is executed to analyze the source code for potential security issues and ode quality problems. The results are printed, and the SonarQube server is expected to be configured in the Jenkins environment.

### Vulnerability Scan - Docker Stage:
This stage performs a vulnerability scan on a Docker image using the Trivy tool, which is designed for container scanning. The script rivy-docker-image-scan.sh is executed to carry out the scanning.

### Build Stage:
The Java web application is built using Maven with the 'clean package' goal. This stage compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application nto a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.

### Deploy-To-Tomcat Stage:
The application is deployed to a remote Tomcat server using SSH. The WAR file built in the previous stage is transferred to the server and deployed to he appropriate directory in the Tomcat webapps folder.

### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) Stage:
This stage runs OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) to perform a baseline scan against the deployed web application. ZAP checks for potential vulnerabilities hile interacting with the application.

Please note that this pipeline assumes the availability of various tools and configurations, such as Docker, TruffleHog, OWASP Dependency-Check, SonarQube, and OWASP ZAP. You will need to ensure these tools are properly set up and available in your Jenkins environment for the pipeline to work correctly.
